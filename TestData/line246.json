For a Front AC application start with 24 ounces or (2) 12 oz. cans of refrigerant. R-134A refrigerant is available at any auto parts store in 12 oz. cans. You will need a separate dispenser like the one shown here by EZ Chill. Avoid \"Stop Leak\" refrigerant types and stick with untreated R-134A refrigerant. Refrigerant cans are designed to be attached to the dispenser full and removed from the dispenser empty. Proceed to thread the first can of refrigerant onto the dispenser. The dispenser will pierce and seal the can. '''Do not''' remove the refrigerant can from the dispenser until the can is completely empty.",
