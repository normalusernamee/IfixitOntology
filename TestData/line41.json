Turn the oil filter clockwise by hand until it is snug. Tightening should require a moderate amount of your strength, but not all of it. If the filter is difficult to turn at the beginning of its threads, stop! You may be cross threading the oil filter. Re-align the oil filter and try again. Do not over-tighten your oil filter. Doing so may cause the oil filter seal to leak and will make removing the oil filter very difficult in the future. Remove the oil drain pan from under the car.",
